The first certification that I'm attempting is the [Red Hat Administration 1 (RH124)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh124-red-hat-system-administration-i). Given my limited experience with Red Hat, it's best to start at the beginning and get the basics right!

The following is an outline for the certification:

- Get started with Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    Describe and define open source, Linux, Linux distributions, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux

- Access the command line
    Log into a Linux system and run simple commands using the shell.

- Manage files from the command line
    Copy, move, create, delete, and organize files while working from the bash shell.

- Get help in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    Resolve problems by using local help systems.

- Create, view, and edit text files
    Manage text files from command output or in a text editor.

- Manage local users and groups
    Create, manage, and delete local users and groups, as well as administer local password policies.

- Control access to files
    Set Linux file system permissions on files and interpret the security effects of different permission settings.

- Monitor and manage Linux processes
    Evaluate and control processes running on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.

- Control services and daemons
    Control and monitor network services and system daemons with the systemd service.

- Configure and secure SSH
    Configure secure command line service on remote systems, using OpenSSH.

- Analyze and store logs
    Locate and accurately interpret logs of system events for troubleshooting purposes.

- Manage networking
    Configure network interfaces and settings on Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers.

- Install and update software packages
    Download, install, update, and manage software packages from Red Hat and DNF package repositories.

- Access Linux files systems
    Access, inspect, and use existing file systems on storage attached to a Linux server.

- Analyze servers and get support
    Investigate and resolve issues in the web-based management interface, getting support from Red Hat to help solve problems.

I will start by creating notes for each section, which I will come back and link to from here. I plan to use this as a cheat sheet for myself in the future. It'll save me from having to Google the same stuff repeatedly!
